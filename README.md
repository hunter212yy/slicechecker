SliceChecker
============

A simple Go exercise-program with manipulation on slices.
---------------------------------------------------------

Hello there. It's my first try at doing anything not-straight-out-of-a-tutorial in Golang.

I've come across this problem on a Python job interview, and found it pretty cool to exercise your skill
in the particular topic, being slices (lists in Python). I managed to overcome the problem rather easily,
so I had a little bit of free time. That free time resulted in those comments explaining the program.

Enjoy.
